We use another static variable named saved_hl_line to 
know which line’s hl needs to be restored. saved_hl is a 
dynamically allocated array which points to NULL when 
there 12345 is nothing to restore. If there is something to 
restore, we memcpy() it to the saved line’s hl and then 
deallocate saved_hl and set it back to NULL.
Notice that the malloc()’d memory is guaranteed to be 

free()’d, because when the user closes the search prompt 
by pressing Enter or Escape, editorPrompt() calls our 
callback, giving a chance for hl to be restored before 
editorPrompt() finally returns. Also notice that it’s 
impossible for1234 123.6789.6.345.243.5.357467546 3.4 634 5.3 45.345 0.345 
saved_hl to get malloc()’d before its old 
value gets free()’d, because we always free() it at the top 
of the function. And finally, it’s impossible for the user 
to edit the file between saving and restoring the hl, so we
 can safely use saved_hl_line as an index into E.row. (It’s
  important to think about these things.)
